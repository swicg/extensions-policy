        This document describes the process and criteria for approving extensions
        for inclusion in the main Activity Streams 2.0 context document.

      <h2>Including Extensions in the Activity Streams 2.0 context document</h2>
      <section>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>Activity Streams 2.0 is a vocabulary for representing social data.
            It is designed to be extensible, so that new terms can be used by
            publishers and consumers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Extensions provide at least the following benefits:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Support specialist vocabularies for specific fields of interest</li>
            <li>Model social software patterns that were not common when
                Activity Streams 2.0 was originally published</li>
            <li>Provide alternate terms or structures for patterns already
                represented in Activity Streams 2.0 that improve the vocabulary's clarity
                or ease of use</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Any publisher can define an extension to Activity Streams 2.0, and use it in
            published documents. For example, a publisher could define an extension
            that provides a term for the favorite ice cream flavor of a person.

                    "@context": {
                        "ic": "https://flavors.example/ns/icecream#",
                        "favoriteIceCreamFlavor": {
                            "@id": "pdg:favoriteIceCreamFlavor",

                        },

                        "Strawberry": "ic:Strawberry",
                        "Pistachio": "ic:Pistachio"
                    }

        <p>
            This publisher, or any other publisher, can create Activity Streams 2.0
            documents that use this extension.
        </p>

              <pre class="example highlight json">
                {
                    "@context": [
                        "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
                        "https://favorites.example/ns/icecream"
                    ],
                    "id": "https://example.com/people/evan",
                    "type": "Person",
                    "name": "Evan Prodromou",
                    "favoriteIceCreamFlavor": "Pistachio"
                }
              </pre>
            </div>
        </figure>
        <p>
            If the publisher uses different extensions in the same
            document with different terms, they will need to resolve
            those naming conflicts by hand.

                        "https://favorites.example/ns/icecream",
                        "https://horse.example/ns/colors"
                    ],
                    "id": "https://example.com/people/evan",

                    "name": "Evan Prodromou",
                    "favoriteIceCreamFlavor": "ic:Chocolate",
                    "horseCoatColor": "horse:Chocolate"
                }
              </pre>
            </div>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Any publisher or consumer can implement this extension, subject to
            the terms of the creator's license(s), if any.
        </p>
        <p>
            Referencing many extensions can be a burden for publishers and consumers.
            Although one or two lines in the @context property of the Activity Streams 2.0
            document may not be a problem, ten or twenty could be. In addition,
            the more extensions that are used, the more likely it is that there will
            be conflicts between terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            If an extension becomes very popular, it may be useful to include its terms
            and namespace in the main Activity Streams 2.0 context document.
            This will let publishers use the extension without having to include
            an additional line of context. It also provides an opportunity to resolve
            conflicts between terms in different extensions in one place.
        </p>
        <p>
            This inclusion does not come without a price. First, the Activity Streams 2.0
            context document is that much larger, which has a cost in terms of readability,
            maintainability, and bandwidth used. In addition, there is work for the
            SocialCG in updating, documenting, harmonizing, and maintaining the context
            document.
        </p>
        <p>
            This Note describes the criteria that the SocialCG will use to decide
            whether the benefits of simplicity and clarity by including extension
            terms in the main context document outweigh the costs of doing so.
        </p>
        <p>
            Properly implemented, this process provides a way to make Activity Streams 2.0
            a continuously evolving vocabulary, serving new needs for developers and
            users, while maintaining the stability of the core terms.

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>These are the steps to including an extension in
            the Activity Streams 2.0 context document.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Publish the extension for review. Extensions can be published
            through the Federation Enhancement Proposal (FEP) process, as Notes of
            the SocialCG, through another standardisation process, or by any other
            organisations or individuals.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implement the extension; see criteria below for implementation requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            List the extension in the Activity Streams 2.0 extensions registry.
          </li>
          <li>
            Propose the extension for inclusion. The proposal should include a justification
            for inclusion of the extension.
          </li>
          <li>
            Vote on the extension. The SocialCG will vote on whether to include the
            extension in the Activity Streams 2.0 context document.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a draft version of the Activity Streams 2.0 context document including
            the extension terms and namespace. This is the time to resolve any conflicts
            with existing names in the context document.
          </li>
          <li>
            Test the draft version of the Activity Streams 2.0 context document.
          </li>
          <li>
            Publish the new version of the Activity Streams 2.0 context document.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Criteria</h2>
        <p>To be included in the Activity Streams 2.0, extensions should meet these requirements.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A unique namespace, distinct from the Activity Streams 2.0 namespace.
            </li>
            <li>
                A JSON-LD context document at a permanent URL.
            </li>
            <li>A document that describes the terms and usage of the extension.</li>
            <li>
                An intellectual property rights policy that is compatible with
                inclusion in a W3C specification.
            </li>
            <li>
                Demonstrated implementation by at least two (2) independent publishers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Demonstrated implementation by at least two (2) independent consumers.
            </li>
