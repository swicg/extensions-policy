        The Activity Streams 2.0 context document is a definition file maintained by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/socialcg/"></a>W3C Social Web Community Group</a> (SocialCG). This document describes the process and criteria for approving extensions
        for inclusion in the main Activity Streams 2.0 context document.

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Activity Streams 2.0, as described in [[activitystreams-core]]
        and [[activitystreams-vocabulary]] is a vocabulary for representing
        social data. It is used by, among others, the [[activitypub]] API and protocol. It is designed to be extensible, so that new terms can
        be used by publishers and consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
          Extensions provide at least the following benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Support specialist vocabularies for specific fields of interest</li>
          <li>Model social software patterns that were not common when
              Activity Streams 2.0 was originally published</li>
          <li>Provide alternate terms or structures for patterns already
              represented in Activity Streams 2.0 that improve the vocabulary's clarity
              or ease of use</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          Any publisher can define an extension to Activity Streams 2.0, and use it in
          published documents. For example, a publisher could define an extension
          that provides a term for the favorite ice cream flavor of a person.
      </p>

                      "favoriteIceCreamFlavor": {
                          "@id": "ic:favoriteIceCreamFlavor",
                          "@type": "@id"

      <p>
          This publisher, or any other publisher, can create Activity Streams 2.0
          documents that use this extension.
      </p>

            <pre class="example highlight json">
              {
                  "@context": [
                      "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
                      "https://favorites.example/ns/icecream"
                  ],
                  "id": "https://example.com/people/evan",
                  "type": "Person",
                  "name": "Evan Prodromou",
                  "favoriteIceCreamFlavor": "Pistachio"
              }
            </pre>
          </div>
      </figure>
      <p>
          If the publisher uses different extensions in the same
          document with the same term(s), they will need to resolve
          those naming conflicts by hand.
      </p>
      <figure>
          <figcaption>

              as an ice cream flavor and as a color of a horse's coat.
          </figcaption>
          <div id="ex1-context" style="display: block;">
            <pre class="example highlight json">
              {
                  "@context": [
                      "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
                      "https://favorites.example/ns/icecream",
                      "https://horse.example/ns/colors"
                  ],
                  "id": "https://example.com/people/evan",
                  "type": "Person",
                  "name": "Evan Prodromou",
                  "favoriteIceCreamFlavor": "ic:Chocolate",
                  "horseCoatColor": "horse:Chocolate"
              }
            </pre>
          </div>
      </figure>
      <p>
          Any publisher or consumer can implement this extension, subject to
          the terms of the creator's license(s), if any.
      </p>
      <p>
          Referencing many extensions can be a burden for publishers and consumers.
          Although one or two lines in the @context property of the Activity Streams 2.0
          document may not be a problem, ten or twenty could be. In addition,
          the more extensions that are used, the more likely it is that there will
          be conflicts between terms.
      </p>
      <p>
          If an extension becomes very popular, it may be useful to include its terms and namespace in the main Activity Streams 2.0 context document.
          The W3C Social Web Community Group (SocialCG) is responsible for maintaining the Activity Streams 2.0 context document, and can add terms for popular extensions.
      </p>
      <p>
          Adding the extension terms to the main context document has several benefits. It lets publishers use the extension without having to include an additional line of context. The extension's terms will be available for all documents that use the Activity Streams 2.0 context, without requiring a namespace prefix. It also provides an opportunity for the SocialCG to resolve conflicts between terms in different extensions.
      </p>
      <figure>

              after it has been included in the main Activity Streams 2.0 context
              document.
          </figcaption>
          <div id="ex1-context" style="display: block;">
            <pre class="example highlight json">
              {
                  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
                  "id": "https://example.com/people/evan",
                  "type": "Person",
                  "name": "Evan Prodromou",
                  "favoriteIceCreamFlavor": "Chocolate"
              }
            </pre>
          </div>
      </figure>
      <p>
          This inclusion does not come without a price. First, the Activity Streams 2.0
          context document is that much larger, which has a cost in terms of readability,
          maintainability, and bandwidth used. In addition, there is work for the
          SocialCG in updating, documenting, harmonizing, and maintaining the context
          document.
      </p>
      <p>
          This Report describes the criteria that the SocialCG will use to decide whether the benefits of simplicity and clarity from adding extension terms to the main context document outweigh the costs of doing so. It is a refinement of the W3C's <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/08/namespaces/">Adding to W3C RDF Namespaces</a> document to the specific needs of the SocialCG, Activity Streams 2.0, and ActivityPub.
      </p>
      <p>
          Properly implemented, this process provides a way to make Activity Streams 2.0 a continuously evolving vocabulary, serving new needs for developers and users, while maintaining the stability of the core terms.

      <h2>Adding terms</h2>
      <p>These are the steps to including an extension in
          the Activity Streams 2.0 context document.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Publish the extension for review.</b> Extensions can be published
          through the <a href="https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/">Federation Enhancement Proposal</a> (FEP) process, as <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/reports/reqs/">Reports</a> of
          the SocialCG, through another standardisation process, or by any other
          organisations or individuals. See "Criteria" below for required content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Implement the extension.</b> See "Criteria" below for implementation requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>List the extension in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Activity_Streams_extensions">Activity Streams 2.0 extensions registry</a>.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Propose the extension for inclusion.</b> The proposal should include a justification
          for inclusion of the extension.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Vote on the extension.</b> The SocialCG will vote on whether to include the
          extension in the Activity Streams 2.0 context document.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Create a version of the Activity Streams 2.0 context document including
          the extension terms and namespace.</b> Versions of the Activity Streams 2.0
          context document are published at <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams-history/">https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams-history/</a>.
          Note that the canonical version of the Activity Streams 2.0 context document
          at <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams">https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams</a> should
          not be changed at this point.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Test the version of the Activity Streams 2.0 context document.</b> Implementers
          should test the new version of the Activity Streams 2.0 context document. If there
          are problems, additional versions can be added and tested.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Publish the new version as the canonical version of the Activity Streams 2.0 context document.</b>
          At this point, the canonical version of the Activity Streams 2.0 context document
          will include the new terms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Publish a new version of the Activity Streams 2.0 Terms
            document.</b>
          This HTML document is served at the https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams URL when HTML is requested, providing documentation
          about all the terms in the context. The new version should include the new terms, and a link to the SocialCG resolution approving the new terms.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <section>
        <h3>Criteria</h3>
        <p>To be included in the Activity Streams 2.0, extensions SHOULD meet these requirements.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A unique namespace, distinct from the Activity Streams 2.0 namespace.
            </li>
            <li>
                A JSON-LD context document at a permanent URL. Services like <a href="https://purl.archive.org/">https://purl.archive.org/</a> and <a href="https://w3id.org/">https://w3id.org/</a> can be used to provide permanent URLs.
            </li>
            <li>A document that describes the terms and usage of the extension.</li>
            <li>
                An intellectual property rights policy that is compatible with
                inclusion in a W3C specification.
            </li>
            <li>
                Demonstrated implementation by at least two (2) independent publishers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Demonstrated implementation by at least two (2) independent consumers.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Extensions to be included MAY meet these criteria:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A security review, either by the submitter, members of the SocialCG, or by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/IG/W3C_spec_review">SecurityIG</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            A privacy review, either by the submitter, members of the SocialCG, or others.
          </li>
          <li>
            An accessibility (A11Y) review.
          </li>
          <li>
            An internationalisation (I18N) review.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Modifying and removing terms</h2>
      <p>
        The W3C policy on namespaces has <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/08/namespaces/#modification">specific requirements for modifying or removing terms</a> from a namespace document such as a JSON-LD context document. In short, terms defined in a Recommendation may not be modified or removed. This would include all published Activity Streams 2.0 and ActivityPub terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SocialCG MAY remove or modify extension terms, recognizing that this will be disruptive to publishers and consumers who depend on the extension term being in the context document. The SocialCG SHOULD NOT remove extension terms without a strong justification. Serious security issues or legal issues, for example, may justify removal. Modifying or removing an extension term MUST be approved by a resolution of the SocialCG.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SocialCG MAY mark terms as deprecated. Deprecated terms are still
        part of the context document, but are documented as deprecated. Deprecating a term MUST be approved by a resolution of the SocialCG.
      </p>

      <h2>Previous Work</h2>
      <p>
        The section on Extensibility in [[activitystreams-core]] says, in part,
        "Some popular extensions are included in the Activity Streams 2.0 namespace
        document [...]". It does not define how extensions are added and which
        criteria are used to decide whether an extension is popular enough to be
        included.

        <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#extensions">The section on Extensions in the Activity Streams 2.0 namespace document</a>

        at a persistant [sic] URL. Approval of extensions will be by the Social Web WG
        until it closes, and after that by the followup Community Group. Process and criteria
